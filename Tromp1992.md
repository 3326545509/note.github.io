The Variational Principle [website](https://stanford.edu/~jeffjar/statmech/lec5b.html#jenson)


**The strategy of the variational principle is to use a problem we can solve to approximate a problem we can't.**


Self-gravity wikipedia

**Self-gravity has implications in the field of seismology because the Earth is large enough that it can have elastic waves that can change the gravity within the Earth as the waves interact with large-scale subsurface structures.**

好恨, 怎么全是量子力学, 是哪些sb说量子力学没用的, 给我站出来!! 我居然什么都不会, 混账xx大学!!!我遇到的挫折你至少要付100%的责任!!

## Action principle
Action principles start with an **energy function called a Lagrangian** describing the physical system. 

The **accumulated value of this energy function between two states** of the system is called the action.

Action principles apply **the calculus of variation** to the **action**. 
 
The action depends on the energy function, and the energy function depends on the position, motion, and interactions in the system.

 variation of the action allows the derivation of the equations of motion without vectors or forces.

### Path variation
An action principle predicts or explains that the particular path taken has a stationary value for the system's action: similar paths near the one taken have very similar action value

The principle of stationary action tells us that the action doesn't change for small variations of the path. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that the action is at its global minimum. Instead, it may be at a **saddle point or a local minimum/maxima**, as long as small perturbations around the path do not decrease the action.

Lagrangian mechanics is a powerful system for analyzing the motion of a system of particles. It can be extended to cover the dynamics of a field.

The Lagrangian function for a particle system is defined as the difference between its kinetic energy and its potential energy. The integral of the Lagrangian function over time is called the action of the system. It was initially believed that a system carried out a motion that minimized its action. This was called the Principle of Least Action. Later it was realized that the motion of a system was such that an infinitesimal variation in the path had no effect on the action of the system. The action was said to be stationary with respect to small variations in its motion.

The potential energy of a system is a function of only its space-time coordinates and the kinetic energy a function of only the time-derivatives of the coordinates. Where a system's motion is subject to constraints there exist a set of generalized coordinates that are compatible with those constraints and hence which simplify the analysis of the system's motion.

Stationarity implies that the system's motion is given by a set of equations known as the Euler-Lagrange equations for the system. For example, for a system of one particle whose potential energy depends upon only one variable x, the Euler-Lagrange equation is
